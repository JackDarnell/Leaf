SPECS FOR LEAF - PLANT GROWING SYSTEM 

Concept: An automatic system for monitoring plants in different rooms that waters them and helps them grow.
ideal goal: a system that could measure growth rates of plants and use that data to figure out accurate watering, fertalizing, and lighting levels/timings. 

Future ideas: timelapse, soil minerals measurement, fertalizer systems, lighting systems

--------------DASHBOARD:--------------

online web interface with these stats:
* room temp - graph of hourly room temperature (with weekly averages?)
* room humidity - graph of hourly humidity (weekly averages)
* room light levels - graph of hourly light levels

* list of plants with pictures
	- Soil Moisture Measurement
	- Name of plant
	- last water date
	- adjust soil watering threshhold


--------------SOFTWARE:--------------

could potentially do something where arduinos can plug into the plant/room sensors and then connect to a raspberry pi main hub for the dashboard and data management. 
	- with this users could have multiple rooms with plants and have them all connect over wifi to a raspberry pi.

ARDUINO:

used for keeping track of plant sensors (analogue inputs)

RASPBERRY PI:

used for running the dashboard, could have a touchscreen on it too or a monitor. Could also store historical data and create backups of your plant info.


DATA STRUCTURES:

room{
	var: temp (how often to update? 20 min?)
	var: humidity (how often to update? 20 min?)
	array: (plants)
}

plant{
	var: last water date
	var: amount of water to give when watering 
	var: soil humidity (update hourly or maybe constantly?)
	var: humidity threshold
	var: plant name
	var: plant image (uploaded by user)
	*******FIGURE OUT GRAPH OF WATER ABSORBTION/data structures for times*******
} -should this be stored on the pi or the arduino? not sure


--------------HARDWARE:--------------

* Arduino Mega (wifi?)
* pi 4 
* soil moisture sensors
* room humidity sensors
* room temp sensor
* power supplies for pi and arduino(s)
